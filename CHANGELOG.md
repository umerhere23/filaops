## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Frontend unit testing with Vitest + React Testing Library (56 component tests)
- CI security audits: pip-audit and npm audit run on every push
- Rate limiting on bulk import/export endpoints (30/minute)
- Runtime API URL config for Docker via `window.__FILAOPS_CONFIG__`
- Barrel exports (`index.js`) for 15 frontend component directories
- Shared status color system (`statusColors.js`) for consistent badges
- Comprehensive user guide covering all FilaOps modules
- Deployment docs: Docker quickstart, prerequisites, troubleshooting
- Backup and recovery documentation
- API conventions documentation with response_model patterns

### Changed
- SQLAlchemy 2.0: replaced 33 deprecated `Query.get()` calls with `Session.get()`
- CSS theming: auth pages and forms migrated to CSS custom properties
- Form accessibility: proper labels, ARIA attributes, error announcements
- Docker: non-root container user, correlation IDs in logs
- Removed deprecated `Machine` model alias; use `Resource` from `manufacturing.py` directly
- Expanded `.env.example` to cover all settings groups
- Frontend: all 70+ components migrated from manual `Authorization` header to `credentials: "include"`

### Fixed
- Accounting rounding errors and BOM cost calculation bugs (#209, #211, #212)
- Unicode checkmark crash in migration 039 on Windows (cp1252 encoding)
- UI bugs and performance issues from walkthrough (#216)
- Removed 10 debug console.log statements from production frontend code
- Version sync between backend VERSION file and settings

### Security
- **Auth tokens migrated from localStorage to httpOnly cookies** — prevents XSS token theft
  - All browser-based auth now uses httpOnly cookies with `SameSite=Lax`
  - `AUTH_MODE` env var (`cookie`/`header`) for rollback safety
  - `COOKIE_SECURE` env var — set `true` in production (requires HTTPS)
  - Programmatic API access via `Authorization: Bearer` header still supported
  - Tokens are **no longer returned** in login/register response bodies (cookie mode)
- Password reset approve/deny changed from GET to POST — prevents CSRF and browser prefetch side effects
- Rate limiting added to token refresh endpoint (`10/minute`)
- Rate limiting added to password reset approve/deny endpoints (`10/minute`)
- Server-side refresh token revocation on logout
