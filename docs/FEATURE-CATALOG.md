## Hidden Features (Backend Only)

These features have API endpoints but no UI implementation.

### Negative Inventory Approval

**Status**: ⚠️ Backend Only

**API Endpoints**:

- `POST /inventory/transactions/{id}/approve-negative`
- `GET /inventory/negative-inventory-report`

**Database Columns** (inventory_transactions):

- `requires_approval`
- `approval_reason`
- `approved_by`
- `approved_at`

**Missing UI**:

1. Pending approval list/notification
2. Approval modal with reason field
3. Negative inventory report view

**Recommended Implementation**:

```jsx
// components/NegativeInventoryApprovalModal.jsx
// - List transactions requiring approval
// - Approve/Deny buttons
// - Reason text field
// - Audit display (who requested, when)

// pages/AdminInventoryTransactions.jsx
// - Add "Pending Approvals" tab or filter
// - Badge showing count of pending approvals
```
